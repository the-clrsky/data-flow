"""Pre-flight checks run before a sync starts: connectivity to both
databases, plus the read/write privileges the sync will need. Everything
runs before any table is touched, so a permissions or connectivity problem
is reported as one clear list of failures instead of surfacing deep inside
the sync loop after partial work has already happened.

Disk space estimation is explicitly out of scope for this pass.
